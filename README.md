## Description
Mental Health resources and emergency response are lacking and often involve municipal law enforcement. This has led to escalated situations where individuals in crisis were severely injured or killed. Many individuals thus avoid seeking assistance/help due to the fear of law enforcement involvement. Cultivate Community is a website that provides  local community resources and support for those in distress, or who love and care for those dealing with mental health struggles and diseases like addiction. It also provides an alternate response model for individuals in mental health crisis.

The Cultivate Community project aims to aid as a bridge to reduce interaction between individuals in crisis and law enforcement. It can provide an alternate response model that utilizes both personal care webs and community directed resources. These resources allow those in crisis to have one less impediment to seeking vital care. Future features will include those requiring the assistance of violence interrupters, immigration defense teams, and for individuals who feel as if they are in an unsafe situation.

This website is the result of a hackathon event organized by [Girl Develop It](https://girldevelopit.com/). Girl Develop It is a nonprofit organization that provides affordable programs for adult women and non-binary individuals to learn web and software development in a judgement free environment.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
